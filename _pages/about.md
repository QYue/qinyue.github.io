I am currently a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Professor [Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com/). 
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity, machine learning, and natural language processing. Specifically, I focus on the following areas:

1. Sociotechnical, with a focus on cybercrime and privacy compliance checks
2. Trustworthy machine learning, particularly in the realms of robustness, privacy, and their interconnections.
3. Data-driven privacy and security, with an emphasis on threat intelligence gathering.

My long-term research goal is to discover and understand critical security and privacy issues in cybersystems or AI systems through data-oriented analysis, and to design and develop innovative solutions to address these issues with robust, private guarantees for different real-world applications.
