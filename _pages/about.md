I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Indiana University, under the
supervision of Professor [Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com/). My research interests include data-driven security and privacy
with a focus on cybercrime and threat intelligence gathering, as well as trustworthy machine learning,
especially on robustness, privacy, and their interconnections. More specifically, my research interests are to discover and
understand critical security and privacy issues in cybersystems or AI systems through data-oriented analysis and to design and develop innovative solutions to address these issues with robust, private guarantees
for different real-world applications.
